README BIODIGS Fig1. JAN29_2026 

DATA: Data is slightly modified from the received versions of excel sheets--removed nonessential legends, renamed data sheets, etc. for simpler R compatibility. 

Uploaded data should include the BioDIGS soil element data, BioDIGS site data, and the EPA National Lakes Assessment ecoregion classification, last updated in August 2025.

CODE: Code is formatted in an R Markdown (.rmd) file. This allows the user to run code chunks using the green play button located in the upper right hand corner of code chunks. To see this, turn the code from "source" to "visual" format; accept the pop-up warning. There is a table of contents located on the righthand side of the code screen. 

To limit errors when running, install all packages using the tiny yellow warning at the top of the document when it is first opened.

COMPUTING: The code was scripted and ran on a Lenovo Yogo from 2023 with 15.7 G of memory.
