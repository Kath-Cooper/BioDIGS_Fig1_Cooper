DATA: Data is slightly modified from the received versions of excel sheets--removed nonessential legends, renamed data sheets, etc. for simpler R compatibility. Uploaded data includes the modified excel sheets from BioDIGs. The ecoregion data from the EPA National Lakes Assessment is too large for GitHub repositories, therefore should be downloaded using the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19idwmx2MuD2UhmwP-ZwlMJLNOjJ6FZv1?usp=drive_link 

Or alternatively, through the EPA website at the bottom of this page: https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/ecoregions-used-national-aquatic-resource-surveys

The ecoregion file contains four files: ".dbf," ".shp," ".prj," and ".shx"

Each of these must be downloaded and in the parent file for the code to work properly.

CODE: Code is formatted in an R Markdown (.rmd) file. This allows the user to run code chunks using the green play button located in the upper right hand corner of code chunks. To see this, turn the code from "source" to "visual" format; accept the pop-up warning. There is a table of contents located on the righthand side of the code screen. 

To limit errors when running, install all packages using the tiny yellow warning at the top of the document when it is first opened.


COMPUTING: The code was scripted and ran on a Lenovo Yogo from 2023 with 15.7 G of memory.
